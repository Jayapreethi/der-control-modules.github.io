# Test Cases

The communication and control framework has been tested on the PNNL campus using a 125kW/250kWh BESS and a building
with a 150kW peak load. Tests involving energy arbitrage, demand charge reduction and MESA charge/ discharge modes
are further discussed in
[Interoperable Energy Storage Control and Communication Framework Development](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891219).
