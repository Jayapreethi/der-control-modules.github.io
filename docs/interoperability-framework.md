# The Interoperability Framework 

The Interoperability Framework, as shown in [](#interop-framework-agents-diagram) and described in
[](#interop-framework-agents-table), provides a set of VOLTTRON agents which
work together to enable seamless integration, control, and optimization of energy storage systems within a grid
environment, improving operational efficiency and grid stability. All agents communicate via VOLTTRON's message bus,
with the data flowing through the bus being stored in a database.
Visualization of the data is achieved through Grafana. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring,
visualizing, and analyzing metrics and log data from the various agents.
